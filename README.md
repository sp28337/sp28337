- Design and manage PostgreSQL databases (migrations, ORM, complex queries)
- Implement caching solutions (Redis) and task queues (Celery, RabbitMQ)
- Write tested, production-ready Python code

**Frontend Development**
- Build modern web applications with React, Next.js, Astro
- Create responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and semantic HTML
- Manage state with Redux and handle TypeScript for type safety
- Optimize performance (SSG, SSR, code splitting)

**Full-stack & Infrastructure**
- Design complete application architecture (database → API → frontend)
- Deploy and manage applications on VPS (Nginx, PM2, Systemd)
- Containerize applications with Docker and Docker Compose
- Implement user authentication (JWT, OAuth2)
- Version control and collaborative development (Git, GitHub)
